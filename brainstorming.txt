top down arcade

tactical/strategy game where you're monsters stopping a adventurer/group of adventurers
platformer

actual ideas:
	ghosts in pacman (how to make it interesting)
	tactical/strategy game where you're monsters stopping a adventurer/group of adventurers

stop the platform player from getting by
resources
	place blocks or something (a la some tower defense)
	action component (hit him, don't let him jump on you)
	upgrade your abilities (get different weapons i.e. hammers)
disadvantages
	ART
	balance? (how to stop form building a wall they can't jump over)
	AI work (too ambitious)
	abstract concept--have to figure out a lot of things
advantages
	it sounds interesting

components:
	building/construction/tower defense
	action (constrained, only walk, jump, etc.)
	sandbox
goal?
	stop players from going through?
	see how many you can stop in a time period?
	open-ended?
	challenge/puzzle? (stop them with these constraints?)
