Thematic goal:
Power trip of platformer minion getting power ups, modifying the level, and
defeating numerous players in a row.

Mechanic goal:
Kill as many players as you can in each wave.

Ultimate goal:
Is there one? Or just sandbox mode, w/ AI getting better each round.

Game flow:
1) Buildling--construct/deconstruct brick
2) Demonstrate you can beat it (also give the AI a baseline to work off of)
3) Play! Players run through, you try to stop them. (Control the number of
players? Pure sandbox then?)
4) Upgrade--based on players defeated, upgrade your abilities?

actual ideas:
	ghosts in pacman (how to make it interesting)
	tactical/strategy game where you're monsters stopping a adventurer/group of adventurers

stop the platform player from getting by
resources
	place blocks or something (a la some tower defense)
	action component (hit him, don't let him jump on you)
	upgrade your abilities (get different weapons i.e. hammers)
disadvantages
	ART
	balance? (how to stop form building a wall they can't jump over)
	AI work (too ambitious)
	abstract concept--have to figure out a lot of things
advantages
	it sounds interesting

components:
	building/construction/tower defense
	action (constrained, only walk, jump, etc.)
	sandbox
goal?
	stop players from going through?
	see how many you can stop in a time period?
	open-ended?
	challenge/puzzle? (stop them with these constraints?)
